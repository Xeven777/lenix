- **Exponential** (default) - Smooth deceleration, feels natural
- **Sine** - Gentle easing in and out
- **Quadratic** - Subtle acceleration
- **Cubic** - Stronger acceleration curve
- **Linear** - Constant speed (no easing)

### Ignoring Elements

Skip smooth scrolling on specific page elements using CSS selectors:

```
.navigation, #sidebar, .modal
```

Multiple selectors separated by commas work too!

## 🔍 Library Detection

The extension automatically scans each page for existing smooth scroll libraries:

### Detected Libraries

- ⚫ **Gray indicator** - No scroll libraries found

**Tip:** If a library is detected, you may want to disable Lenis to avoid conflicts with the page's existing implementation.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Smooth scrolling isn't working

1. Ensure the extension is **enabled** in the popup
2. Check if the page has **conflicting scroll libraries** (green indicator)
3. Try **disabling conflicting libraries** in browser DevTools
4. **Refresh the page** after making changes
5. **Reset settings** to defaults and try again

### Scrolling feels janky

1. Reduce the **Duration** slider (scroll faster)
2. Try a different **Easing Function** (linear if having issues)
3. Disable **Lerp** for simpler scrolling
4. Lower **Touch Multiplier** if on mobile

### Page doesn't scroll at all

1. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)
2. Verify extension has **content script permissions**
3. Try reloading the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
4. Disable extensions one by one to find conflicts

### Settings not saving

1. Ensure Chrome sync is **enabled** (Chrome Menu → Sync)
2. Check extension has **storage permission**
3. Try logging out and back into Chrome
4. Click "Reset" then "Apply" to refresh
